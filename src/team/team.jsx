                        I have been working in the mortgage industry since 2005 with various reputable lenders. I started out working with very large banks like Bank of America and JP Morgan Chase, but as time passed, I scaled down to smaller more customer-friendly mortgage companies.  As a Senior Loan Officer for Basis Lending, I have localized my services to just AZ and CA and have become an expert in those markets. I focus my attention on a handful of clients every month which allows me to deliver the tailored service my clients expect. Whether you are looking to purchase a home or complete a refinance, please do not hesitate to reach out to me with any questions. I am happy to help!
